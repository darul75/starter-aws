**StarterAWS** NodeJS module for AWS instances easy management : start/stop/reboot.

## Why ?

Because ecchymose in the nose. 

Tired of checking frenquently my AWS instances status, I will combined it with some angular directive to make it easier.

But first can be used at your node application startup, and force a clean start of your AWS instances if needed.

## Install

~~~
npm install starter-aws
~~~

## Usage

### Command line
```
node starter-aws.js <AWS-accessKeyId> <AWS-secretAccessKey> <AWS-region> <AWS-instancesId> <NO-IP-auth> <NO-IP-hostname> <state>
```

### Application
```javascript
var starterAws = require('starterAws');

starterAws.starter(
  {
    accessKeyId: '', 
    secretAccessKey:'', 
    region: '', 
    instancesId: '',
    state: ''    
  }, 
  function(err, status) {
  // process err
  
  }
);
```

## Options

* `accessKeyId` AWS accessKeyId
* `secretAccessKey` AWS secretAccessKey
* `region` AWS region
* `instancesId` AWS instance(s) id, ',' separtor if multi, exemple: i-53613f50,i-53613f30,i-53613f20
