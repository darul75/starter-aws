# StarterAWS [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/starter-aws.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/starter-aws) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/darul75/starter-aws.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/darul75/starter-aws) [![Total views](https://sourcegraph.com/api/repos/github.com/darul75/starter-aws/counters/views.png)](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/darul75/starter-aws)

**StarterAWS** NodeJS module for AWS instances easy management : start/stop/reboot.

## Why ?

Because ecchymose in the nose. 

Tired of checking frenquently my AWS instances status, I will soon combined it with one angular directive to make it available in your administration UI.

But first can be used at your node application startup, and force a clean start of your AWS instances if needed.

A daemon is started and fetch all your zone instances status every minute ( until now time is hard coded )

## Install

~~~
npm install starter-aws
~~~

## Usage

### Command line
```
node starter-aws.js <AWS-accessKeyId> <AWS-secretAccessKey> <AWS-region> <AWS-instancesId> <state>
```

### Application
```javascript
var starterAws = require('starterAws');

// THIS CALL IS MADE BY DEFAULT, options attributes have to be set, with by state start or stop...
starterAws.starter(
  {
    accessKeyId: '', 
    secretAccessKey:'', 
    region: '', 
    instancesId: '',
    state: ''    
  }, 
  function(err, status) {
  // process err
  
  }
);

or

// OTHER CALL here a start
starterAws.start(
  {
    accessKeyId: '', secretAccessKey:'', region: '', instancesId: ''
  }, 
  function(err, status) {}
);

or

// OTHER CALL here a stop
starterAws.stop(
  {
    accessKeyId: '', secretAccessKey:'', region: '', instancesId: ''
  }, 
  function(err, status) {}
);

or

// OTHER CALL here a reboot
starterAws.reboot(
  {
    accessKeyId: '', secretAccessKey:'', region: '', instancesId: ''
  }, 
  function(err, status) {}
);

// OTHER CALL here a to get status
starterAws.status(function(err, status) {

// status my return:
/*[ { InstanceId: 'i-53613f18',
    ImageId: 'ami-c37474b7',
    InstanceType: 't1.micro',
    State: 'stopped' },
  { InstanceId: 'i-98f372d2',
    ImageId: 'ami-3c5f5748',
    InstanceType: 't1.micro',
    State: 'stopped' } ]
